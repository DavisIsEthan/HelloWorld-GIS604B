# My name is Ethan Davis.
## This is the sub-header text of a page about a student who may be the silliest goose to have ever been a silly goose. 

That's right. Even the most doltish members of the family *Anatidae* can't compare. *"But Ethan,"* I hear you say, *"how can you be so certain that you are among the goofiest of geese?"*. It's simple, really. I know of preicsely zero waterfowl that earned a B.S. in physics from the University of New Hampshire (go wildcats!) or that are working on an M.S. in Data Science online at the University of Arizona (go wildcats, again!). I conjecture that this is because geese are much less silly than I, and thus spend their time freely flying and exploring/interacting with the world around them instead of, say, doing homework and paying taxes. 


Furthermore, our fine feathered friends do not require a canoe when exploring the beautiful rapids James River of southern Virginia, nor do they use funny hiking boots when taking in the views from trails in the Blue Ridge Mountains, as I do in either case. Never once have I seen any waterproofed birds lug around camera equipment to impart light onto chemical-coated pieces of acetate (medium format film forever!). Finally, I humbly request that you ask yourself if you have ever witnessed a bird spend their time watching very silly looking Formula 1 cars driving around in what are effectively complicated circles. I would guess you hadn't, what sort of animal would do such a silly thing?!

It is on this evidence that I make the claim: I am the silliest of geese.
